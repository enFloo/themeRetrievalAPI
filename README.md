React Application with API & GUI hosted in AWS Elastic Beanstalk
=============

This is an API with two HTTP endpoints that retrieves data & a GUI allowing users to CRUD data to a PostgreSQL database hosted in AWS RDS. Both were created in an AWS EC2 Amazon Linux 2 instance and successfully deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Python3.8

API Reference
-------------

### Endpoints

#### "GET /allproducts HTTP/1.1" 200

Returns JSON data of all products.

Example:

jsonCopy code
`
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Product1",
    "ThumbnailURL": "example.com/product1-thumbnail.png",
    "SourceURL": "example.com/product1-source.png",
    "Category": "Category1"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Product2",
    "ThumbnailURL": "example.com/product1-thumbnail.png",
    "SourceURL": "example.com/product1-source.png",
    "Category": "Category2"
  }
]
`

#### "GET /product/count/start HTTP/1.1" 200

Paginates through the data with the amount "count" of elements it'd like returned at start which is 1-indexed and which element it will start at. Returns JSON, returns nothing if count or start are N/A.

Parameters:

-   `count` (necessary): the number of elements to return
-   `start` (necessary): the 1-indexed position to start from 

Example:

Request: `GET /product/2/1`

Response:

jsonCopy code

`
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Product1",
    "ThumbnailURL": "example.com/product1-thumbnail.png",
    "SourceURL": "example.com/product1-source.png",
    "Category": "Category1"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Product2",
    "ThumbnailURL": "example.com/product1-thumbnail.png",
    "SourceURL": "example.com/product1-source.png",
    "Category": "Category2"
  }
]
`

If the data is successfully created, the API will return a `200 OK` response with the ID of the new data in the response body. Example:
